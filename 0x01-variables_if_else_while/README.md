# **C - Variables, if, else, while**
In this project, I learnt how to make use of the arithmetic, relational, logical, and boolean operators in C.  Also, I learnt how to declare and assign variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, how to make use of the `if`, `else if` and `else` statements and also the `while` loops.                                                           ## Executable Files                                                                                                                                                             - [exe](exe): This is a folder that contains all the executable files from the compilation of the programs in this project.                                                     ## **Tasks**                                                                            - **0.
